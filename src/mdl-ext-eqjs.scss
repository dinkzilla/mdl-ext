/**
 * Element Queries are a new way of writing CSS styles so the rules apply to individual elements
 * on the page, instead of to the whole page as one document like in regular CSS Media Queries.
 * This SASS file includes the eq.js, https://github.com/Snugug/eq.js, prolyfill which is an easy to use
 * drop-in solution to JavaScript powered element queries. It works well with SASS,
 * and element queries work without requireing a server to run.
 *
 * Feel fre to write your own element query stylesheet using one of the other libraries, e,g:
 *   [EQCSS]               - (https://github.com/eqcss/eqcss)
 *   [CSS Element Queries] - (https://github.com/marcj/css-element-queries)
 *   [BoomQueries]         - (https://github.com/BoomTownROI/boomqueries)
